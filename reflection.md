What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

This challenge has taught me everything about padding, boders and margins really. I did learn about them in the codecademy part of this week but I only fully understood them while working on the layout for the website we're making. 

I realized that it can be really really frustrating. In the beginning nothing was working the way it should which annoyed me quite a bit. Time-boxing was quite useless since I didn't make any real progress in the time I gave myself. The positioning pairing challenge was really good for reorganizing my knowledge, kind of untangling my thoughts.

I thought it was quite simple to position stuff like text and so on top of my layout. Doing the generall layout was a pain in the beginning but got slightly better as I did moe research to get my stuff done.

I'm working with a 3200x1800 px monitor thats in my laptop and an external 1920x1080 one. This really messed up my layout since switching the monitor would result in the layout being destroyed. Really want to learn bootstrap fast!
