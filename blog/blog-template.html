	<p>The DBC experience seems to be a lot more then an experience but more a complet change of ones lifestyle while in the programm. Coming straight out of (German) High School I'm excited to experience a different and more efficient style of learning that I must commit all my time to. Im guessing this style of learning is very rewarding since a lot of progress is made in a short period of time, something I've never really experienced in school.

	Something I wasnt aware of it that I seem to be the youngest by far, which makes me a bit nervous, but it's nothing I worry about to much. Am I nervous about going to DBC in generall? I am, but I think everybody feels the same way. I also found it very helpful that Shereef talked about what people typically worry about, it broke the ice.

	Sadly, due to some communication errors we didnt manage to actually pair. 

	At this stage I find wireframing quite useless, most pasges will look identical anyways. I do understand why we're told to do so (good practise and important to getting used to it). I'm sure once we'll be working on more complex tasks it will greatly improve the workflow and speed things up a lot.
