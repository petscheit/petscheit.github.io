		<h2>CSS concepts - The Box Model</h2>

		<p>
      		A very important part of understanding CSS is to know what the "Box Model" is and how it works. The box model defines how content and it's attributes relate to each other on your website. In essence it tells your browser how big your content must be displayed and where to put it. 
      		The box model is made up of three attributes that can be assigned to any object on your site (object being any kind of element/content). The most obvious one is the actual height and width of your content container. It's the only place where you can put your content (eg. text or a picture). Around the content container we have something called padding. The padding will expand the percepted size of a content container but the actual content doesn't have more space to be displayed. You can basically think of it like the margins in a word document.The same background color and a "padding" around your content.

        <br>
	    <br>
	        Around the padding we have the border of the content. It's the the border around the padding and you can think about it like the borders of the sheet of paper you printed your content on.

	    <br>
	    <br>
	    	Last and equally important is the margin. The margin is an invisible padding that goes around the border. Essentially it puts a transparant shell around our content which can be very helpful to position things in CSS and be sure that nothing uses a possible gap to screw up the entire layout. Think of it as part of the content we use for positioning content but can never see. It's a space holder basically. And here something for the visual learners :)
