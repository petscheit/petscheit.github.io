		<h2>Storing passwords</h2>
		<p>
      		Storing passwords on ones server is a very complicated process (if you want them to stay safe). It's interesting to see how new technologies are developed to combat new potential attacks. I imagine that 10 years ago almost all passwords where stored in a data base as clear text. I also imagine that sites like this still exist until today. 
      		<br>
      		<br>
      		So storing passwords in clear text in a data base is obviously a bad idea. But what other posibilities do we have? When thinking about this I thought that hashing the passwords would be a good and safe approach (in essence a hash algorithm takes any kind of file or string and calculates a result. This result will always be the same when you add the same string or file but once a single bit (of the file or string) is changed you'll receive a completly different result. If you want to learn more check this out: http://m.metamorphosite.com/one-way-hash-encryption-sha1-data-software). When you hash a password you run it through the algorithm and only save your hashing "result" in the data base. When a user trys to log in his password is hashed and compared with the stored hash in the data base. If he entered the same password his hash matches the data base. As I learned this is a bad idea since the most common hash algorithms (md5 ans SHA-1) can actually be decrypted over google. These algorithms are so common that most hashes have been calculated already and can be found online very easily.  
      		 <br>
      		 <br>
      		  Next idea I had was to simply encrypt the passwords and when a user trys to log in you encrypt the password with the public key and check if the encrypted password matches the one in the data base. Also sounded good in the beginning but problems would arise if you have a large amount of users. Eventually people will use the same password at some point and those would result in the same encrypted password in your data base. Once that happens a hacker would know that it's probably a very common password and calculating the private key for the entire database would be a matter of days. 
    		  <br>
    		  <br>
		      I did some more research and heard about hash and salting. This method includes hashing algorithms and some "salt". The idea of it is actually quite simple. The "salt" is a random string of characters (very important that it's completly random and note tied to a users username or something like that) that is different for every user. You can think of it as a random second password. When the user types his password some "salt" is added (can be stored as clean text in the database) and then hashed. It's, just like in the other methods matched with the data base then to decide if it's the right password or not. The amazing thing about this approach is that even if users have the same password a completly different hash is stored in that database. Breaking the hash is also basically impossible since one would have to crack every password seperatly which would take a long long long long long time. Like insanly long.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's important to note that I knew quite a lot about encryption and hashing algorithms before. It's something that has always interested me. I find it a bit worrying that this kind of technology protects the entire internet but so little people know how it works.
