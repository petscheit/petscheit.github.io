      Alright so the first week is basically over and I've completed most of my tasks. I'm quite happy that we started out to learn about version control and how to properly save code in the beginning, always good to start training those important habits first. Version control seems to be a very important part of coding and it makes perfekt sense. Never really thought about the existence of this kind of software before -> nice to learn about it. I'll give you a little introduction discussing the general benefits (those that I know of, being completly new to this)

        The core idea and benefit of version controll is to be able to jump back to any version of your code at anytime (just like a Windows restore point for all you windows users out there). Obviously loads of smart little functions have been added to the git software but I want to focus on the core idea here. When updating and working on code (fixing bugs or adding new features) it can always happen that you overlook a big bug that damages the functionality. Using version controll probably can fix these kind of problems easily (it ensures that you always have a "restore point") and you're able to roll back the update.

        Git is also very helpfull when it comes to understanding changes you've made. Since git forces you to give a short discription of the changes you've made before you save them you'll always have them for every version of code which makes understanding your code alot easier. This is extremly helpfull when you work on the same code with a team and you must understand someone elses code.

      Git really starts to shine when using it with Github. Github is basically git on the Internet. I read about a nice analogy saying Git and Github are like a USB stick and Dropbox. Git only uses your local machine to store all your data while Github stores all of it on the internet. This allows coders to share their projects and collaberate in a very efficient manner. Github is also one of the key drivers of the open source movement because it enables coders from all over the world to work on then same piece of code without ever needing a physical meeting.
