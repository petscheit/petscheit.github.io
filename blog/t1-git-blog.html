		<h2>Hello World!</h2>
		<p>
	      Alright so the first week is basically over and I've completed most of my tasks. I'm quite happy that we started out to learn about version control and how to properly save code in the beginning, always good to start training those important habits first. Version control seems to be a very important part of coding and it makes perfekt sense. Never really thought about the existence of this kind of software before -> nice to learn about it. I'll give you a little introduction discussing the general benefits (those that I know of, being completly new to this)
	    </p>

	    <p>
        The core idea and benefit of version controll is to be able to jump back to any version of your code at anytime (just like a Windows restore point for all you windows users out there). Obviously loads of smart little functions have been added to the git software but I want to focus on the core idea here. When updating and working on code (fixing bugs or adding new features) it can always happen that you overlook a big bug that damages the functionality of your code. properly using version controll fixes these kind of problems (it ensures that you always have a "restore point") and you're able to roll back the update without much trouble.
        </p>

        <p>
	    Git is also very helpfull when it comes to understanding changes you've made. Since git forces you to give a short discription of the changes you've made before you save them you'll always have them for every version of code, which makes understanding changes in code alot easier, especially when you're collaberating and it's not your own.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    When using it with Github, Git really starts to shine. Github is basically git on the Internet. I read about a nice analogy saying Git and Github are like a USB stick and Dropbox. Git only uses your local machine to store all your data while Github stores all of it on the internet. This allows coders to share their projects and collaberate in a very efficient manner. Github is also one of the key drivers of the open source movement because it enables coders from all over the world to work on then same piece of code without ever needing a physical meeting. 
		</p>

		<p>
	 	Storing your own code on Github is a good idea. Not only is it a reliable and free backup of your data, but also a great tool when it comes to visualizing your changes. When clicking on a file in one of your Github repos you can find a button saying history in the top right. When clicking all commits that have been made for that file get listed. This is also possible in Git but Github highlights what has been removed and added which can be quite useful. On top of that the collaberation features are great and it's also helpful to have a bunch of public repos which might come in handy when looking for a job.

		This weeks was quite alright, material wasnt that hard and I got throught it quite quickly. Setting up my windows machine was a pain and I'm not really sure why I've installed a virtual linux machine yet (using the windows Git and sublime app and it seems to be working just fine). Have the feeling that the documentation of the computer setup is missing a couple of things for windows machines running a virtual machine so I'm hoping my questions will be answered in the email I sent to the phase 0 team. Another thing I dont really understand yet is why git must be run as a terminal application. Up till now it seems to me like a simple intergration into Sublime Text or the file explorer would speed up the process. Im guessing it will make sense in a couple of weeks :).
