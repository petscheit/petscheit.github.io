      Alright so the first week is basically over and I've completed most of my tasks. I'm quite happy that we started out to learn about version control and how to properly save code in the beginning, always good to start training those important habits first. Version control seems to be a very important part of coding and it makes perfekt sense. Never really thought about the existence of this kind of software before -> nice to learn about it. I'll give you a little introduction discussing the general benefits (those that I know of, being completly new to this)

        The core idea and benefit of version controll is to be able to jump back to any version of your code at anytime (just like a Windows restore point for all you windows users out there). Obviously loads of smart little functions have been added to the git software but I want to focus on the core idea here. When updating and working on code (fixing bugs or adding new features) it can always happen that you overlook a big bug that damages the functionality. Using version controll probably can fix these kind of problems easily (it ensures that you always have a "restore point") and you're able to roll back the update.
