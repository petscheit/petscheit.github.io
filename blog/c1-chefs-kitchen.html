      The DBC experience seems to be a lot more then an experience but more a complet change of ones lifestyle while in the programm. Coming straight out of (German) High School I'm excited to experience a different and more efficient style of learning that I must commit all my time to. Im guessing this style of learning is very rewarding since a lot of progress is made in a short period of time, something I've never really experienced in school.

        Something I wasnt aware of it that I seem to be the youngest by far, which makes me a bit nervous, but it's nothing I worry about to much. Am I nervous about going to DBC in generall? I am, but I think everybody feels the same way. I also found it very helpful that Shereef talked about what people typically worry about, it broke the ice.
